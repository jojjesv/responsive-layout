        Child Labor in India
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is sad that for a long time child-labor has been in vogue in India. They are seen working at hotels and restaurants, factories
        and houses. Children are the automatic choice of the employers. For, they work more but are underpaid.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Working Conditions of Child Laborers:
      </h2>
      <p>
        Child labor presents a grim picture of the socio-economic condition of a large section of our population. In a large overgrowing
        family, where there is hardly a square meal a day, the young child is compelled to go to work to earn bread.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working under hazardous conditions they start living a life of perpetual unhappiness and frustration. It is a tale of deprivation
        and longing.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Causes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Poverty, over-population, parental neglect and social callousness turn them into child labors.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Consequences
      </h2>
      <p>
        The engagement of child labor is a heinous social offence. Only a diseased society keeps up this evil practice. Children
        are born to live and bloom freely. Everyone should see to the full expression of their potentials. For,
        <em>‘what is done to children, they will do to society’</em>.
